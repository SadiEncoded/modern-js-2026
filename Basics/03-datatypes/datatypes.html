  <h1>Data Types In JavaScript</h1>
  <p>
    Understanding data types is crucial for effective programming in JavaScript, as they determine how data is stored, manipulated, and interacted with in your code.
  </p>
  <p>JavaScript has several data types including:</p>
  <h3>Primitive Datatypes</h3>
  <p>Primitive data types are immutable and are accessed directly by value.</p>
  <p>Stored directly in the "Data Stack". Where it is accessed directly.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>String: Sequence of characters. Must be on quotes or backticks.</li>
    <li>Number: Integers as well as floating point numbers.</li>
    <li>Boolean: Logical Entities/ True or False.</li>
    <li>Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.</li>
    <li>Undefined: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.</li>
    <li>Symbol (ES6): Unique value that is often used as an identifier for object properties.</li>
    <li>BigInt (ES2020): Large integers that exceed the range of Number type.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3> Reference Types (Objects)</h3>
  <p>Reference Types are objects that store references to data rather than the data itself.</p>
  <p>Stored in the "Heap". Where it is accessed by reference.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Object: Collection of key-value pairs.</li>
    <li>Array: Ordered list of values.</li>
    <li>Function: Block of code designed to perform a particular task.</li>
    <li>Date: Represents dates and times.</li>
    <li>RegExp: Represents regular expressions for pattern matching within strings.</li>
    <li>Error: Represents runtime errors.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Type Conversion</h3>
  <p>JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that variables can hold values of any data type and types can be changed at runtime. Type conversion can be done explicitly using functions like <code>String()</code>, <code>Number()</code>, and <code>Boolean()</code>, or implicitly by JavaScript during operations.</p>

  <h3>Static Typed Vs Dynamic Typed</h3>
  <p>JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that variables can hold values of any data type and types can be changed at runtime. In contrast, static typed languages like Java or C++ require variables to be declared with a specific data type before they can be used.</p>
  <p>Typescript is superset of JavaScript that adds static typing functionality into JavaScript. It makes code more robust and easier to maintain by catching type-related errors at compile time. Learn Typescript late after mastering JavaScript basics.</p>
