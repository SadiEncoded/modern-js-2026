  <h1>Stack Vs Heap</h1>
  <p>
    In JavaScript, memory management is handled through two primary areas: the stack and the heap. Understanding the differences between these two memory areas is crucial for writing efficient and effective code.</p>
  <h3>Stack Memory</h3>
  <p>The stack is a region of memory that stores primitive data types and function call information. It operates in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) manner, meaning that the last item added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Stack memory is typically faster to access and manage because of its organized structure.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Stores primitive data types (e.g., numbers, strings, booleans).</li>
    <li>Faster access due to its LIFO structure.</li>
    <li>Memory is automatically managed; variables are removed when they go out of scope.</li>
    <li>Limited in size; large data structures cannot be stored on the stack.</li> </ul>

  <h3>Heap Memory</h3>
  <p>The heap is a region of memory used for storing objects and reference types. Unlike
  the stack, the heap does not have a strict organization, allowing for dynamic memory allocation. This flexibility comes at the cost of slower access times compared to stack memory.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Stores reference types (e.g., objects, arrays, functions).</li>
    <li>Slower access due to its unorganized structure.</li>
    <li>Memory management is handled by JavaScript's garbage collector, which frees up memory occupied by objects that are no longer referenced.</li>
    <li>Can accommodate larger data structures since it is not limited in size like the stack.</li>
