  <h1> Variables In JavaScript </h1>

    <h3> What is a Variable? </h3>
    <p>
      A variable in JavaScript is a named container that stores data values. It allows you to store, retrieve, and manipulate data throughout your code. Variables can hold different types of data, such as numbers, strings, objects, and more.
    </p>

    <h3> Declaring Variables </h3>
    <p>
      In JavaScript, you can declare variables using three keywords: <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>const</code>.
      , each with its own characteristics:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>var</strong>: Declares a variable with function scope. It can be re-declared and updated.</li>
      <li><strong>let</strong>: Declares a block-scoped variable. It can be updated but not re-declared within the same scope.</li>
      <li><strong>const</strong>: Declares a block-scoped constant. It cannot be updated or re-declared. The value must be assigned at the time of declaration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Variable Naming Convensions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Only letters,numbers,underscore and dollarsigns</li>
      <li>Can't Start With A Number.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Multi-word Formating</p>
    <ul>
      <li>camelCase =  firstName</li>
      <li>underscore =  last_name</li>
      <li>Pascal =  BirthDate</li>
      <li>lowercase =  joinedyear</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Example Usage </h3>
    <p>See the script and console for the usage!</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Variables are fundamental in programming as they allow you to store and manipulate data dynamically. Understanding how to declare and use variables effectively is essential for writing efficient JavaScript code.
